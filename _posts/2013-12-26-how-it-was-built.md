This site was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on a computer running Ubuntu and hosted on the open source software development website [GitHub](https://github.com/).

A tutorial by [Andrew Munsell](https://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=Blog%20Redirect)
was used to get the site up and running.

Most of the text was written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is made extrememly simple and intuitive using the online editor [prose](http://prose.io/).
