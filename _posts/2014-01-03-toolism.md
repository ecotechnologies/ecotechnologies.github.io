## Toolism


Tools, a means to  an end. Or are they? The elaboration of tool varieties and noted by eminent thinkers such as Karl Marx demonstrates they have value beyond there identified use. Elaorate designs, decoration and valuable materials are invested in the creation of these objects.

Design for function varies by culture, geography and the interplay of these with the materials on hand give rise to the diverstiy seen today.

The focus of this area I should imagine will be hand tools, althouth those which can me mechanised in a sustainable way are of course accepted.

Hammers, blades, axes and adzes are thought to be first tools. The extra leverage of a pole or stick added to the first lithic blades are leading to the later. Others followed, though in a purely philosophical sense teeth, nails and hands as vices, scrapers and as a striking implement could be included within this loose tool definition.

In the context of this website it is the use of tools widely in the future will be addressed. The place of tools, in particular those used  by hand which have an efficiency and tenebale future in terms of energy required on a systems level  as opposed to that used merely in its use considered in deciding on its utility.

The scythe is one which is close to my heart as an occasional bread winner and one which is truly a joy to use. This is my mind is an example of one hand tool which has mostly disappeared, at least in the developed world,  which is now being realized as a efficient hand tool which can replace mechanical means. The strimmer or whipper snipper is a faster mechanized alternatively, but not so much faster that the lower quality effect is has upon pasture or even the grass verge one is just trying to tidy up.  (as opposed to other s such as th hammer which has never lost its place as a useful part of a tool set).
