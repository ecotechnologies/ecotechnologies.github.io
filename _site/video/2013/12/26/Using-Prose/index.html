 <h3><a href="">Using prose</a></h3>

    <p>This short post is rather self-referential as it's about how to make itself!
Online text editors are not conventionally seen as apropriate technology,
but they can certainly help run collaborative websites.
The technology <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> is completely open source and cuts out the crap
of clunky content management systems (CMS). See below how.</p>

<h2>Prose and Github</h2>

<p>To understand Prose.io you must first have a grasp of GitHub.
Prose is a free <em>plug-in</em> to your GitHub account. Grant it permissions
and it will be able to see all your projects and files and enable
editing. Yes, you CAN edit the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
files used on this site using GitHub's own editor. But it is not
intuitive or visually appeally. Enter Prose.io.</p>

<h2>Why prose</h2>

<p>As you can see <a href="https://github.com/ecotechnologies/ecotechnologies.github.io/edit/master/_posts/2013-12-26-Using-Prose.md">here</a>,
the GitHub editor is functional and neat. But it wasn't designed to build
websites using .md files. Therefore, you have to type all the various
markup symbols (e.g. <code>[link name](http://link.url)</code> for links) manually
and this can be a pain, especially if you are new to Markdown.</p>

<p>The alternative is to do your text editing offline and then push the
files to GitHub. This works great and the majority of this post was
actually writting offline. But there are three reasons why Prose is
more suitable for collaborative website editing:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's user friendly for newcomers to GitHub and 'coding', making the
Ecotechnologies website easier to edit.</li>
<li>Because the Markdown file format is quite new, offline editors for it
are not very good anyway (Prose is actually better than all I've tried!)</li>
<li>It can behave as a CMS, with different people allocated different user rights
to publish.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A short tutorial on Prose.io</h2>

<p>Below is a short tutorial I made to showcase what Prose.io is and how
to use it to add to this website in particular.</p>
