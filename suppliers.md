Intro...

## Second hand

We recommend looking at second options first and foremost for tools and equipment. Why?

- Cheaper
- Encourages a re-use economy and rewards anti-hoarding
- Gets useful stuff out of dusty cellars and into the real economy
- Older materials are sometimes better quality 

Good sources of second hand equipments start with the obvious and ubiquitous [Ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/), 
a site not to be underestimated....
